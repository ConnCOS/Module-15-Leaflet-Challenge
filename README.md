# Module-15-Leaflet-Challenge
About

This two-part Module Challenge incorporates Leaflet mapping, HTML, JavaScript and use of a GeoJSON feed from the U.S. Geological Survey to create maps showing, in part one, earthquake visualizations by location, intensity, and depth, and in an optional part two, a second mapped dataset illustrating the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. (Not completed.)

Tools

Acquiring a GeoJSON dataset for earthquake activity visualization.
Incorporating maps from openstreetmap.org for map illustration/location purposes

Key Steps

Pulling JSON information and creating a Leaflet map object
Writing functions for color selections, earthquake magnitude
Creating markers of varying colors to illustrate the different data
Creating a loop through the data with the associated colors and markers
Creating a legend to explain the gathered data shown

Support Notes

TA Carlos Fernandez provided exceptional support in debugging the markers and loops; Calendly tutor Sandhya Kumari helped with issues of cleaning up syntax errors and camel case, and fellow student Juliet Hamilton offered coding assistance on the legend.
